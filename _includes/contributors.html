                        <p>Prof Ackland is a member of the Australian Society for Medical Research, and on the Cancer Council Victoria, Medical and Scientific Committee. She has been involved in the Australian Synchrotron Access Program to acquire funding for research utilizing a number of beamlines X-ray fluorescence and the imaging and medical beamline. Her work in the field of cancer includes the development of a cell culture model for the study of breast cancer.  This model has contributed to understanding the process of breast cancer metastasis termed “epithelial to mesenchymal transition”.  The human cell culture cancer model developed at Deakin University in her laboratory was the first to demonstrate plasticity in response to challenge with environmental factors. The cancer model has subsequently had wide application for investigations into cancer pathways and the mechanisms that contribute to carcinogenic changes. Professor Ackland supervises PhD students and is involved in the undergraduate teaching of cell biology and the molecular basis of disease in the biological science and biomedical courses.</p>
