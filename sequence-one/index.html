    <h1>What is metastatic breast cancer?</h1>
</div>
<div class="content">
    <p class="intro">The first module within the sequence focuses on contextualising the stimulus-response model. The idea in this module is to understand metastatic cancer as the issue, and to understand what can be observed under a microscope: the epithelial-mesenchyme transition. This module provides requisite activities to put the students into an investigative research mindset. It is possible that this module could take 1 hour of class time.</p>

    <h3>Teacher background information</h3>
    <p>A study of cancer in relation to uncontrolled growth is taught when teaching the VCE Biology Study Designs Unit 2 Outcome 1: How is continuity of life maintained. Students should therefore be familiar with some basic features of cancer. Metastatic or secondary breast cancer is a condition where cancer cells have spread to another tissue in the body and will therefore need exploring and explaining. With a basic understanding of metastatic breast cancer and an introduction into the epithelial-mesenchyme transition as the process necessary for tumor cells to spread, module 2 focuses on the microscopic element of metastatic breast cancer from researching therapies, i.e. surgery and radiation, to signal transduction inhibitors.</p>
    <p>It is in the context of Professor Leigh Ackland’s work at Deakin University that metastatic breast cancer is studied. Professor Ackland’s work provides an opportunity to use contemporary research to study the stimulus response model including: reception, signal transduction and cellular responses, in addition to further appreciating the complex structure of a cell and the nature of scientific research.</p>
    <h4>More information</h4>
    <p>Metastatic cancer is a condition in humans where a cancer (wherever it is in the body, i.e. breast, lung, bowel, prostate) is in two or more places. The cancer has spread into an adjacent tissue because of its uncontrolled growth or tumor cells have detached themselves and traveled via the blood or lymph. Metastatic breast cancer occurs when a breast cell carcinoma – a tumor that has formed from epithelial cells (carcinomas are cancers formed from epithelial cells that line the inside and outside of the body), can travel to and take up in another tissue, i.e. the bone. However, the phenotype of the cancer retains some epithelial breast cell characteristics (as well as having the features of cancer cells) and not bone cell characteristics. Therefore, it is not called bone cancer but instead, metastatic or secondary breast cancer.</p>

    <h4>Activities</h4>
    <div class="activity">
        <p>[Engaging and Exploring]</p>
        <p>Activity 1.1 - <strong>What is metastatic cancer?</strong> (10-15 minutes)</p>
        <p>Students are asked what they understand about cancer before metastatic cancer is explained and students’ ideas are written or drawn on the board. The video of Lesley’s story prompts the discussion before students are asked to explore the idea of researching metastatic cancer. The questions are explored and explained with the use of both the video microscopy and the stop animation before the students role-play the changes of a carcinoma cell. Ligand receptor binding is a part of the process while transduction and the cellular response is not studied here.</p>

        <h5>Think-pair-share and Brainstorm</h5>
        <p>Student are asked:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>How would the carcinoma cells get to the bone?</li>
            <li>What steps do these cells need to take to leave the tumor tissue?</li>
            <li>What cells in the body migrate?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Encourage students to draw and or list down their ideas and then invite students to share their thoughts. While the teacher can write students ideas onto the board, students are invited to draw their explanations on the board if they need to.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="activity">
        <p>[Explaining]</p>
        <p>Activity 1.2 - <strong>What is an epithelial-mesenchyme transition?</strong> (30-40 minutes)</p>
        <p>The video of the epithelial-mesenchyme transition is shown and it is explained that a cell in a tissue becomes a completely different cell type when it is able to do different things: changing structurally and functionally (its phenotype changes). An epithelial cell can become a mesenchyme cell and this process is referred to as an ‘epithelial mesenchyme transition’ (E.M.T).</p>

        <h5>Group role-play</h5>
        <p>Refer to <a href="{ site.baseurl }/doc/Module-1-Worksheet-1-Diagram-AW.docx">Worksheet 1 (MSWord 585KB)</a></p>
        <p>In this activity, students are provided with a labeled picture of the differences between an epithelial and mesenchyme cell. Working in small groups their task is to represent the epithelial-mesenchyme transition using role-play. They must represent the five pieces of information involved in the transition in addition to representing a receptor and a ligand.</p>

        <p>Using a labelled diagram of epithelial and mesenchyme cells, students must create a piece of process-drama to represent:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The lock and key mechanism of receptor-ligand</li>
            <li>The change in adhesion molecules (cadherins)</li>
            <li>Mobility</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The teacher can rove around to assist students and provide feedback. Moreover, two groups can be asked to perform so that other groups can see the process from the outside.</p>

        <p>Exit Pass: Question Answer Written Responses</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Define metastatic cancer?</li>
            <li>Describe the process that carcinoma cells must go through to be able to enter the lymphatic or blood vessels and to travel to another tissue in the body?</li>
            <li>What questions do you have about metastatic cancer?</li>
