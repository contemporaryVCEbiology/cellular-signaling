    <h1>Signalling Molecules</h1>
</div>
<div class="content">
    <p class="intro">The forth module within the sequence expands on the topic to include signaling molecules within the whole body and students have the freedom to choose a molecule from the categories of neurotransmitter, hormone, cytokine or pheromone. They relate it to signal transduction in addition to inter-cellular communication. In this way, their knowledge of the stimulus response mechanism is consolidated while their knowledge of tissue interactions via nerves, blood and close or direct contact: neuronal, endocrine, paracrine and contact-dependent, is constructed. </p>

            <p>How do other signaling molecules work in the body?</p>

    <h4>Activities</h4>
    <div class="activity">
        <p>Activity 4.1 - <strong>What are the intracellular pathways of other molecules in the body? </strong> (1.5 hours)</p>
        <p>[Peer and Summative Assessment/SAC Opportunity]</p>
        <p>Assessment: Outcome 2 The students apply a stimulus response model to explain how cells communicate with each other. </p>
        <p>This activity provides an opportunity for students to investigate novel molecules in the context of a signaling molecule pathway. Starting off by eliciting pre-existing knowledge doing a while body drawing the students then choose a signaling molecule and decide on a mode of representation that students must answer several questions that promote an understanding on inter-cellular mechanisms as well. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic signalling molecules are chosen in addition to different effector tissues.</p>
        <h5>Whole body drawing</h5>
        <p>In groups of three or four students use large pieces of butcher’s paper to draw the inside of the human body and students share their understanding of the inside of the body. The teacher focuses on the endocrine system and nervous system as systems that use signaling molecules to coordinate functions of the body.</p>
        <h5>A song/script/essay/Power Point presentation/roleplay/labelled drawing.</h5>
        <p>Individuals or pairs research the inter and intracellular processes involving neurotransmitters, hormones, cytokines and pheromones on a target tissue.</p>
        <p>In this way the signal transduction pathway as the intracellular mechanism, in addition to information learned about the extracellular signaling molecules, can be extended and consolidated.</p>
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: the study design “does not require the study of specific chemicals (i.e. G protein pathways, names of second messengers).”</p>
        <p><strong>Rubric:</strong> The minimum amount of information students must make visible include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Without this signaling molecule the body would ___</li>
            <li>Name and nature of the ligand/s and source cell/s</li>
            <li>Type and position of receptor it effects</li>
            <li>Mode of transmission</li>
            <li>The correct representation of events: reception, steps in transduction and the cellular response.</li>
            <li>An appropriate message reflected as a response to the signaling molecule.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="activity">
        <p>[Evaluative]</p>
        <p>Activity 4.2  - <strong>What are the different types of cellular signaling?</strong> (45-50 minutes) Students are given the opportunity to present their work to the teacher or whole class. Marks are given according to the rubric above or otherwise devised by the teacher. Can include a peer feedback and self-reflection sheet as part of the assessment.</p>
        <h5>Presentations</h5>
        <p>The students are given 5 minutes to present their work: the stimulus-response mechanism for their signaling molecule and the action of a current drug.</p> 
        <h5>Exit Pass</h5>
        <p>In conjunction with the presentations students understand what each person or pair has researched and chooses a signalling molecule to answer the following questions.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Was it a/an: Endocrine signal? Paracrine signal? Neuronal signal? Contact-Dependent signal?</li>
            <li>Can it pass through the membrane or not?</li>
            <li>Does this mean it is hydrophobic or hydrophilic?</li>
            <li>What was the target tissue/cell?</li>
            <li>What was the response?</li>
        </ol>
